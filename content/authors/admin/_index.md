I am researching away at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai/">Microsoft Research AI</a>, where I mostly hang out with <a href="https://www.ecekamar.com/">Ece Kamar</a>. I’m intrigued by how decisions are made, in both humans and machines. By formalizing the cognitive principles that underlie how we learn and reason, I build systems that collaborate with humans to solve computational tasks. I also work with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr6">AI for Earth</a>.

I find myself growing ever more concerned that the world isn’t using AI safely, fairly, or ethically. To that end, I've worked with <a href="https://www.nist.gov/director/vcat/jake-taylor-assistant-director-quantum-information-science-white-house-office-science">Jake Taylor</a> at the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)</a> and with the <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/">Partnership on AI</a> on understanding the impacts of technology. Our report on establishing standards for the deployment of criminal justice risk assessment tools can be found <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/artificial-intelligence-research-and-ethics-community-calls-for-standards-in-criminal-justice-risk-assessment-tools/">here</a>.

I received a B.S. in Cognitive Science and B.A. in Global Affairs from Yale, where I spent four wonderful years with <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/">Brian Scassellati</a>. I'll be starting my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a>, in part funded by the <a href="https://www.truman.gov/">Truman Scholarship</a>, in Fall 2020.
