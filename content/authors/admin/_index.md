I am a Member of Technical Staff at Anthropic and PhD student at MIT CSAIL advised by <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~jda/" >Jacob Andreas</a> and <a href="https://interactive.mit.edu/about/people/julie" >Julie Shah</a>. I've spent summers at the Boston Dynamics AI Institute, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Facebook AI Research (FAIR), and before grad school, two years as an AI Resident at Microsoft Research. I did my undergrad at Yale, where I got my start in research with <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/" >Brian Scassellati</a> and read a lot of dead philosophers.

I'm interested in building agents that learn representations from rich human knowledge, whether directly (e.g. from users) or through priors (e.g. from LMs). Currently, I'm thinking a lot about how to utilize pretrained models in conjunction with human feedback to interactively learn aligned preferences/rewards.

A history buff at heart, I care deeply about working with non-academic communities to create safe, ethical, and equitable AI. I currently serve as a Special Government Employee for the <a href='https://www.diu.mil/' >Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)</a>. In a previous life, I worked at the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/" >White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)</a>,  <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" >National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>, and <a href="https://schmidtfutures.com/" >Schmidt Futures</a>. I also serve on the advisory board of the <a href="https://jackson.yale.edu/" >Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs</a>, where I co-teach a course on AI for policymakers.

I love being outdoors, even in the brutal Boston winters. A current goal is to run a sub-3:00 marathon (<a href="https://marathonview.net/query/496351000014330618" >this is how I'm doing</a>). Reach out to chat about research, policy, or running! Preferred subject line: <a href=/img/LilShadyShad.jpg >Your cat is dope.</a>
