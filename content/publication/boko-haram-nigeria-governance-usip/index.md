abstract: The Yale Capstone Team was convened to produce technological solutions for the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) PeaceTech Lab in order to help track, analyze, and mitigate violence. The project specialized in Nigeria and focused on violence in the middle belt and northeastern states, especially as they related to Boko Haram, government elections, and religious differences. This project relied primarily on Crimson Hexagon analysis social media data, Armed Conflict Location and Event (ACLED) conflict tracking data, and client data collected in a September 2016 SMS survey.
